                <h1>Omurice: A Casual Eat</h1>
                <p>
                    Omurice is a famous "yoshoku" dish, you might have seen it on Japanese TV or in anime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Omurice is made up of ketchup fried rice with chicken and vegetables and then wrapped in a beautifully fluffy omelette.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More generally, omurice is composed of two main foods: the rice and the surrounding "omurice" omelette. The following ingredients are used for simple and easy variations of the dish
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a quick recipe and a great way to use up left over rice. Like with any fried rice, day old rice always fries up the best! It's also great if you have lots of eggs that you need to use up!

                <h2>Cooking Tips!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a non stick pan.</li>
                    <li>Add a little bit of oil, and then wipe it away with kitchen paper so there's a very thin layer of oil there. (I use this technique for pancakes too!) You can also use oil spray or butter.</li>
                    <li>The pan should be a medium low heat, you need time to scramble them a bit before adding your filling and flipping them.</li>
                    <li>Add the rice filling WHILE the omelette is still runny and cooking, if you wait until it's fully cooked the omelette will brown too much. The goal is a smooth, yellow omelette.</li>
                    <li>Use a spatula to fold the edges over. I use a silicone spatula that I usually use for baking, it's smaller and more precise than a regular spatula.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Rice Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, heat your pan on medium with 2 tsp olive oil and 1 tsp butter.</li>
                    <li>Dice ½ white onion and add it to the pan. Sauté until softened.</li>
                    <li>Slice 40g mushrooms and cut 150g chicken breast into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Once the onions are softened, add your mushrooms and chicken to the pan.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 tbsp white wine to the pan and fry everything until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Add the 200g of cooked rice with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add 3 tbsp ketchup and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 tbsp of green peas with a pinch of parsley. Mix in and fry for one minute.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Omelette Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a separate non-stick pan on medium, this will be for the omelette.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, crack 5 eggs and add 2 tbsp milk and 1 tsp olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Whisk for 1 minute or until the eggs are a bit fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Add a little bit of oil to the pan and then wipe the excess away with a paper towel. This will stop too many browned spots appearing on your omelette.</li>
                    <li>Pour half of your mixture into the pan and using chopsticks (or a fork), whisk the omelette a little while it's cooking. This will make it nice and fluffy. Work quickly, it cooks fast!</li>
                    <li>When it's half cooked, add half of the rice to the centre of the omelette.</li>
                    <li>Fold one side over the top of the rice using a spatula and then on that same side, fold it again so that the rice is wrapped in the omelette.</li>
                    <li>Slide it onto a plate.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 4-8 for the next dish.</li>
                    <li>Place a paper towel over the omelette to absorb any excess oil, you can also adjust the shape into the classic rugby ball omurice shape at this point too.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with ketchup and parsley for decoration.</li>
                    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
