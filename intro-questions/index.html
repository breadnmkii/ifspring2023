			<li>I'm Brendan, a Junior in Computer Engineering</li>
			<li>I'm enthusiastic about anything computer, whether its software or hardware. Though I can't say too much about my design abilities, I'm hoping to complete an HCI minor to learn how to better engineer computer interfaces--and not just functional ones.</li>
			<li>I've worked with HTML and JS, though CSS hurts my head. Here, I've been able to further explore webdev through 330 and 204.</li>
			<li>I'm aiming to really learn the aspects that make a website as equally appealing as functional, and any modern webdev design practices.</li>
			<li>Screens come in all sorts of resolutions and interactivity. They'll have to resize, be tappable, draggable, clickable in all sorts of ways.</li>
			<li>https://www.youtube.com: The website manages to keep me glued to it for hours on end, so I'd say it's annoying yet intelligent recommendation system has definitely been designed well to keep users on the page.</li>
			<li>https://beta.reactjs.org: The beta react docs are really well written and presented. The color scheme and comfortable text displays make it easy to read, and the in-line interactive sandboxes work well to demonstrate functionality.</li>
			<li>www.google.com: It's simple. A single search bar and button can give you pretty much anything you want.</li>
