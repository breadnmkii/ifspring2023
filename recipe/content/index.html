            <p>Omurice is composed of two main foods: the rice and the surrounding "omurice" omelette. The following ingredients are used for simple and easy variations of the dish:</p>

                <h5>Instructions</h5>
                <h4>RICE</h4>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>First, heat your pan on medium with 2 tsp olive oil and 1 tsp butter.</li>
                    <li>Dice ½ white onion and add it to the pan. Sauté until softened.</li>
                    <li>Slice 40g mushrooms and cut 150g chicken breast into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Once the onions are softened, add your mushrooms and chicken to the pan.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 tbsp white wine to the pan and fry everything until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Add the 200g of cooked rice with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add 3 tbsp ketchup and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 tbsp of green peas with a pinch of parsley. Mix in and fry for one minute.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>OMELETTE</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a separate non-stick pan on medium, this will be for the omelette.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, crack 5 eggs and add 2 tbsp milk and 1 tsp olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Whisk for 1 minute or until the eggs are a bit fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Add a little bit of oil to the pan and then wipe the excess away with a paper towel. This will stop too many browned spots appearing on your omelette.</li>
                    <li>Pour half of your mixture into the pan and using chopsticks (or a fork), whisk the omelette a little while it's cooking. This will make it nice and fluffy. Work quickly, it cooks fast!</li>
                    <li>When it's half cooked, add half of the rice to the centre of the omelette.</li>
                    <li>Fold one side over the top of the rice using a spatula and then on that same side, fold it again so that the rice is wrapped in the omelette.</li>
                    <li>Slide it onto a plate.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 4-8 for the next dish.</li>
                    <li>Place a paper towel over the omelette to absorb any excess oil, you can also adjust the shape into the classic rugby-ball omurice shape at this point too.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with ketchup and parsley for decoration.</li>
                    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Note:</h6>
                <p>
                    Use day old, leftover rice from the fridge (or defrosted from the freezer) for the best results on the fried rice filling (generic fried rice tip!).

                    Useful for demonstrating how an interactive ingredients list can be used to check off the necessary cookware and preparation needed prior to cooking. The interactivity of being able to select different serving sizes and automatically calculate the new ingredient proportions seemed to be a good reference for implementing that same functionality into my website.

                    The New York Times Cooking website provided a very formal and official presentation of their recipes. The very simplistic yet high resolution layout of the website presents a single beautiful dish image with clear-cut information on the recipe. I will likely implement the website's structure and concision to do away with the (sometimes) annoying narratives that preface many recipe websites.

                    This website, aside from being the main recipe variation selected for my dish, I had selected for its design. Although I think the layout holds too much padding and whitespace, I liked the font and color scheme that of its general design. The use of lowercased letters gives it a very casual and home-y feel that I believe is most representative of omurice, a traditional Japanese comfort food.

                    This website presents its information very well through its various sections throughout the scroll. I wanted to follow the same nature of this website to help organize the various sections that my recipe site will present (introduction, recipe, additional information, etc.).

                    This is a highly scroll-interactive website that comes equipped with video-streamable backgrounds. Although I doubt that I will be able to incorporate such a feature (yet) I found this as a good opportunity to get the website down as an example of what can be possible in terms of interactivity through something as simple as the scroll wheel and pointer.

                    This was a very modern website design in terms of its wide margins and focus on the center. The colors were simple (only three) and the layout of content makes it a great reference for how to properly structure clean website design.
